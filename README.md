# Learning OpenGL

I want to learn OpenGL and C++ so I will be uploading whatever I end up making.

## Part 1. Wireframe Renderer

### Reason:
In my grade 11 CS class we were learning Java(which I already knew). During my spare time in that class I would code my own things such as recreating Rogue(1980) and a 3D wireframe renderer. I want to try to recreate the same wireframe renderer but in C++ and OpenGL

#### Day 1:
-Installed GLFW and GLAD to the project and used it to create a window based on the GLFW website

## Update

I found an Open GL tutorial that teaches without using OpenGL, instead you build the tools yourself. the Tutorial is by [ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy) and you can find it [here](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki)
